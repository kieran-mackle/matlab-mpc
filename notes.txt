The main files to run the MPC are:
    - mpc_control
    - mpc_update
        - solve_qp.m (codegen)
            - dense_qp.c
    - forward_simulate

The mpc update can be solved using MATLAB's quadprog function, or by
using gurobi. In the latter case, solve_qp.m must be written to a mex file 
using codegen, as it contains a call to the C code, dense_qp.c. The
commands to do this are:
    cfg = coder.config('mex');
    cfg.CustomInclude = fullfile("/opt/gurobi912/linux64/include/");
    cfg.CustomLibrary = fullfile("/opt/gurobi912/linux64/lib/libgurobi91.so");
    codegen -config cfg solve_qp -args {0,0,0,H,G,Omega,omega,constraint_weights, Uopt_mat} dense_qp.c -v


    Important: the input args to the command above must be of the correct size,
    which depends on the control horizon and timestep. As such, codegen must
    be run each time these settings are updated.
